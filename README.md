## **Game Design &amp; Implementation**

Set of aliens have found a new planet and they have started bases there. They travel using spaceships in the planet. But inhabitants try to attack them with bombs. These alien spaceships need to survive from the coming obstacles such as bombs until it finds a rescue base. Along the journey it meets bombs, fruits and fuel.

Those bomb will reduce the ship life by **10**. If ship allows any bomb to pass it that bomb will hit the margin and damage the ship. These bombs not always look like bombs but also like fruits or fuel. Fruits will increase the health by **1**. But again these fruits will be bombs. Fuel will increase the fuel and they also can be bombs.

Ship can survive by bomb by sending a missile to collide with a bomb. It will increase the score by **10** for each actual bomb hit.

## **Game level Design**

When level increases each obstacles&#39; linear velocity also getting increased by 10.
